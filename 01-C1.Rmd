# Fundamentals of Computer Programming Languages

<span class="newthought">
If you've never programmed a computer, you should. There's nothing like it in the whole world. When you program a computer, it does exactly what you tell it to do. It's like designing a machine-any machine, like a car, like a faucet, like a gas-hinge for a door-using math and instructions. It's awesome in the truest sense: it can fill you with awe.

## Why should Psychologists learn to program?

The benefits of learning to program for Psychologists are numerous. Programming makes data-analysis more efficient, accurate, and transparent; and, opens new doors for new analyses that would not be practical or possible without programming. Experiments are often run on computers, so programming is important for designing, creating, and implementing experiments themselves. Programs can be written to formally express psychological theories, so programming can also help a researcher iron out and clearly express their own ideas about psychological processes.

Computing technology plays an important role in psychological research, and there are many kinds of proprietary software

The website [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) lists many common programming problems and solutions for them across many different languages. Itâ€™s a great resource to get a sense of the breadth of programming languages, for examples of working code, and for problems to solve when learning to program.

### Algorithms

Here are some questions you should have about algorithms. What are algorithms? What is algorithmic thinking/ what is an algorithmic approach to problem solving? How do you combine the programming concepts in the next sections to write algorithms for solving problems with code? How would you explain the concept of an algorithm to another person? And, can the problem I am trying to solve be answered with an algorithmic approach.

An algorithm is simply a set of detailed instructions for accomplishing a task, or the infallible recipe for solving a problem. If the step-by-step instructions are followed exactly, the algorithm will always provide the answer to the problem it was intended to solve. Real-world examples of algorithms are recipes for preparing food, or IKEA instructions for putting together furniture.
